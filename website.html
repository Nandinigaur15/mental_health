          <p>Mental health,as defined by WHO(World Health Organization), is "state of well-being in which the individual realizes his/her abilities,
          copes up with normal stresses of life working productively and fruitfully and can contribute to his/her community". It is the capacity of an
          individual to feel, think and act in a certain way keeping in mind personal,social and cultural boundaries that are attached. Mental health 
          surrounds emotional, psychological and social well-being.All over the world mental health problems are most commonly faced by students in higher 
          education, hence a system for identification of those who are at higher risk and allowing the targeted provision of help can create a difference 
          in mental health status all over. </p>

        Mental health is important. It impacts how we feel, think, and behave each day. Our mental health also contributes to our decision making, problem 
        solving, how we deal with stress, and how we can relate to others in our lives. That's why, we have to always care about our own mental health. 
        It's for the sake of our social well-being. Our mental health plays an important part on a daily basis, promoting productivity in activities like
        work, school, etc. If you adapt easily to new environments, then it means both your mental and emotional health are healthy.

          <p><b>1."Mental illness is like any other medical illness": a critical examination of the statement and its impact on patient care and society
          by Ashok Malla, MBBS, MRCPsych, Ridha Joober, MD, PhD, and Amparo Garcia, MA, MPPPA</b>
            <br>  The nature of mental illness has been the subject of passionate discussion throughout history. In ancient Greece Plato promoting
            a mentalist definition of mental illness, was the first to coin the term "mental health," which was conceived as reason aided by temper and
            ruling over passion. At around the same time, Hippocrates,taking a more physicalist approach, defined different mental conditions as a
            variety of imbalances between different kinds of "humours." Griesinger almost 2 centuries ago was the first to state that "mental illness
            is brain illness," an expression that has provided a strong impetus to the more recent medical conception of mental illness.

          <p><b>2.The potential of virtual reality to support adolescent mental well-being in schools: A UK co-design and proof-of-concept study by Siobhan
          Hugh-Jones, Michelle Ulor, Trish Nugent, Sophie Walshe, Mike Kirk</b>
            <br>  Mental health interventions delivered via virtual reality (VR) technology are available for treatment of adult anxiety and phobias.
            VR for other mental health needs is now being explored. A small number of studies have examined VR acceptability and helpfulness for 
            adolescents in conjunction with clinician support. No studies have examined the potential of VR to support adolescents in schools as a
            form of prevention. We present our early-stage work to produce and field-test a youth co-designed VR intervention for use in schools to 
            support adolescent well-being. Co-design decisions led to a focus on stress reduction via emotion regulation, supported by a
            mindfulness-based approach.

        <br><br>
        <center><img src="Img/Chakrasana.jpg" height=400 width=600></center>
        <br>
        Method: Lay on your back. Ensure that your feet are firmly planted on the ground and bend your knees. Position your palms upward while bending 
        your arms at the elbows. Put your palms on the floor on either side of your head and rotate your arms at the shoulders. Take a deep breath in, 
        apply pressure to your legs and palms, and raise your entire body in an arch. Allow your head to softly droop behind you as you look back and 
        relax your neck. All four of your limbs should equally bear the weight of your body. Maintain the position for 15 to 20 seconds.

        <br>
        Method: Kneel on the mat and place your heels there. Breathe in and raise your arms above your head. Breathe out and bend your upper body forward.

        <center><img src="Img/Paschimottanasana.jpg" height=400 width=600></center>
        <br><br>
        Method: Begin by assuming Dandasana. Make sure your knees are slightly bent and your legs are stretched out in front of you. Raise your arms 
        upward while keeping your spine straight. With an exhale, bend forward at the hips to place your upper body on your lower body. Grip your big 
        toes with your fingers. Try to touch your knees with your nose. Hold the position for 30 seconds.

        </div>
          <p style="text-align:justify">
          Music has powerful effects on the mind. Different styles of music can have a significant effect on a person's mood very quickly, and it can
          help them experience and process a wide range of emotions, from happiness to excitement, as well as sadness, calmness, and thoughtfulness. 
          Music therapy involves using a person's responses and connections to music to encourage positive changes in mood and overall well-being.
          Music therapy can include creating music with instruments of all types, singing, moving to music, or just listening to it.
          <br><br>
          <h3><b>How it is important for Anxiety</b></h3>
          Some studies suggest that music can reduce blood pressure and the heartbeat, which can have a direct impact on how stressed a person feels.
          Music affects the amount of stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, that the body releases, and reducing these hormones can help
          relieve symptoms of anxiety.
          </p>
          <h3><b>How it is important for Depression</b></h3>
          Studies suggest that music therapy can improve symptoms of depression, with those undergoing music therapy along with standard treatments for
          depression. Listening to music can also release dopamine, which is a hormone that makes people feel good, and endorphins, which are hormones
          that can induce happy moods and relieve pain. Although music therapy is not a cure for depression, it can offer short-term benefits Trusted 
          Source by improving mood and encouraging connection and self-expression.
